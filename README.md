# 339reCode

Experiment 0 in using gitHub

The contents of this repo are Python and Arduino code rewrites for PHYS 339.
The goals of the rewrites are two:
1) To update all Python code to Python 3
2) To clean up, comment, and/or rewrite all code to make it
a) simple
b) easy to maintain
c) easy for students to understand

Original code was written by Mark Orchard-Webb at unknown dates.
Rewrites have been undertaken primarily by Gregory Bell, beginning in 2021, and with input from me, Robert Turner.
